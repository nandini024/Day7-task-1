                                                            <p>Chocolate ice cream can make a great dessert. It has a contrasting allure; it’s also rich, cool, and creamy with dark roasted flavors only cocoa can impart. This chocolate ice cream is for the real die-hard chocolate-lovers in the group. It’s sweet and malty, with the tiniest bitter tones to balance that sweetness. Almost right in the middle between dark chocolate and milk, it’s the kind of chocolate ice cream that doesn’t leave you wishing there was more chocolate in the mix or less.

                                                                <p>The first thing I did after eating a piece of this banana cake was cut another slice. That’s how good it is. If you have a soft spot in your heart for banana bread, you are going to love banana cake. This subtly sweet cake has the full flavor you’d expect from banana bread and a hint of cinnamon, but the texture puts it firmly in dessert territory. Unlike a dense slice of banana bread, this cake is soft, tender, and incredibly moist. While this cake is great on its own, a generous layer of cream cheese frosting makes it truly incredible. Best of all, like many of my favorite cake recipes, it’s simple, unfussy, and easy to make.
